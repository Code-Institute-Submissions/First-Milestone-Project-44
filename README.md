# Title: Architectural services and design

The website represents the online presence of an architecture company in UK, which offers a wide range of architectural services from concept sketches to construction details.

 
## UX
 
The website is designed to be easy to follow and accessible for everyone, no matter how experienced or inexperienced is with the architectural process. 
As you open the website, the first page provides you a sufficient information to realise is the company's services are something that you look for or not. 
The colour palette chosen for the website is neutral grays and black, a modern and elegant style, often used by architects in their presentations. 



## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 
- Bootstrap 4 CDN library (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Font Awesome icons library (https://fontawesome.com/)
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
   - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.



## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

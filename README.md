# Title: Architectural services and design

The website represents the online presence of an architecture company in UK, which offers a wide range of architectural services from concept sketches to construction details.

 
## UX
 
The website is designed to be easy to follow and accessible for everyone, no matter how experienced or inexperienced is with the architectural process. 
As you open the website, the first page provides you a sufficient information to realise is the company's services are something that you look for or not. 
The colour palette chosen for the website is neutral grays and black, a modern and elegant style, often used by architects in their presentations. 



## Features

The project represents the website of an architecture company. It consists of four pages “Home, Prices, About and Contact”.
Each page has been designed to be easy to read and navigate.
Also they feature a header with a navigation menu and a footer with contact details and links to social media accounts.
All the information available to the viewer is enough to have an idea of the company’s profile, how the company can help them and what are their services.

The “Home” page is divided in three main sections spread between the header and the footer.
At the top, the first section is dedicated to the hero image, an image representative for the company and a welcome title.
The middle section represents the opportunity for the company to describe the services it offers at different stages of a project.
The bottom section was created to highlight a selection with photos from various projects created by the company.

The "Prices" page is entirely dedicated to listing the services that the company has to offer and the price for each individual service. This way the client knows from start how to plan his budget and whether he wants to appoint the company to do his requests. The presentation style for the services remains in the same line as on the main page, with blocks of text on a grey background. 

The "About Us" page has a short presentation or the company's profile and the type of work they do. The grey and black style continues here as well. 

The last page is the "Contact" page, which has a main image that shows clearly where you are in this website and of course the form that any potential client can fill in and submit for any supplementary information it may require. 


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 
- Bootstrap 4 CDN library (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Font Awesome icons library (https://fontawesome.com/)
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
   - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.



## Testing

I have tested each individual page to see if it loads correctly all the elements and if it looks good on mobile, tablet or desktop screen. 

All the links provided are ok and send the user to the specific destination.

The navigation menu has no problems and on smaller screens it transform in a 3-bar icon with a drop menu. 

For mobile view, the images presented in the projects section, change their position into one column and have no zoom effect as on a bigger screen. 

The types of text used across the website are clear and readable on all types of screens (small or large). 

The contact form has been tested to see if it returns an error in case the user hasn't provided the mandatory fields and also if the email provided is not recognised as an email address it will prompt the user for action. 
If all the mandatory fields are filled correctly and the information is submitted, a pop-up window will apear to confirm that the information has been sent successfully. 

## Bugs

I notice that although the contact form and the submit button function well as shown on Bootstrap, they don't function well together and at the same time. Although no field is filled, the submit button still returns the message that it wwas sent successfully.
Also, the form doesn't recognise the email field as the type of email required to have all the elements of an email adress.
